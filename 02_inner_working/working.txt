Python is interpreted language

python inner working

* we need to tell interpretor and which script to learn
     python chai.py
       |      |
 interpretor  script 

interpret(script)-> generate Byte code=> install python VM


step 1:- Compile to Byte code
                       |
                       low level code & platform independent
->Byte code runs faster

.pyc -> Compiled python (frozen Binaries)

__pycache__ (for internal use only)

Source Change & Python Version

hello_chai.cpython-312.pyc
->Works only for imported files
->Not for top level files



-----PVM-----
-> code loop to iterate byte code
-> Also known as "Run time Engine"
-> Also known as "python interpreter"

Byte code is NOT machine code
-> Python specific interpretation
->cpython,jython,IronPython,Stackless,PyPy
    |
    standard implementation
