1)
In python everything is object
 -it create everything first as object
 -then make memory reference
 -it creates reference of every value
 -Reference is always immutable

 >>> username = "Neelam" // username is connected to reference of neelam
>>> username
'Neelam'
>>> username = "More"
>>> username
'More'

2) 
>>> x = 10 reference created of value 10
>>> y = x  points to reference 10
>>> x
10
>>> y
10
>>> x= 15 x is now pointing to reference 15
>>> y  this is still pointing reference 10
10
>>>
